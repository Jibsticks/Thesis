# Thesis employs logistic regression, random forest, decision trees, neural networks, and extreme gradient boosting models to identify key drivers of low retention. Data preprocessing techniques, including cleaning, standardization, and encoding, are applied, along with strategies like SMOTE + ENN for data balancing![image](https://github.com/Jibsticks/Thesis/assets/143664492/7b5c8db9-ea11-4fb2-92c0-ca98cef7231b)
